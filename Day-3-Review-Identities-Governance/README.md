# Day 3: Custom Role and Role Assignment Lab

## Overview
On Day 3, I practiced Azure identity and governance concepts by creating a custom role, assigning it to a user, creating a storage account, and cleaning up resources.

## What I did

- Created a **custom role** named "Custom Reader Role - Storage Only" with permission to read storage accounts.
- Assigned the custom role to my user account.
- Created a **storage account** in the resource group.
- Verified the role assignments and resource creation.
- Cleaned up by deleting the role assignment, custom role, storage account, and resource group.

## Key Learnings

- How to define and create custom roles with JSON.
- How to assign roles to users and check role assignments.
- Creating Azure Storage accounts via CLI.
- Clean up Azure resources properly.
